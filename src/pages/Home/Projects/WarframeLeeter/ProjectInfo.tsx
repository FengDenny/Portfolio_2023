    Initially, I had to perform trial and error to see what worked and what didn’t in 
    <span className="font-bold">Postman</span> to finally get all the endpoints up and running. Using these points, I created functionalities using <span className="font-bold">React</span> that can help display my data as user friendly as possible, while building components based on what was needed to display these data.
